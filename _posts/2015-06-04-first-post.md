This is the first post of my github website.

Af first I decided to just write things about __machine learning__, __algorithms__, 
mainly on what I learned when playing with algorithms and data. 
However, it seems a big challenge for me to write technical blogs everyday,
especially in the very beginning. 
Instead, I will also blog something simple, easier, but also things that I learned.

And I hope that I will be able make blogging as a daily routine work.
If I am not blogging, I am preparing material for blogging.
