Here is a [5 minutes markdown tutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:
 
| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |
 

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
x <- 5 + 10
print(x)
~~~

python code with syntax highlighting

Python

```python
def foo():
 print 'hello markdown'
```
